# Clfr Sticker

## Introduction

Clfr Sticker is an innovative browser-based note-taking application designed to enhance productivity and organization. It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes directly within their browser, saving these notes in local storage. This ensures that all notes persist across sessions, allowing users to pick up right where they left off every time they open their browser.

##  Purpose

The primary goal of Clfr Sticker is to provide a seamless and efficient note-taking experience within the browser environment. By leveraging local storage, Clfr Sticker ensures that users' notes are always available, without the need for external storage solutions or cloud services. This makes it an ideal tool for users who need quick and easy access to their notes while browsing the web.

## Key Features

- **Persistent Notes:** Notes are stored in local storage, allowing them to be retrieved and edited in future browser sessions.
- **Draggable and Resizable Notes:** Each note can be easily moved around and resized, providing a flexible and customizable note-taking experience.
- **Individual Note Titles:** Each note comes with its own title, helping users to organize their notes more effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design that makes note-taking quick and easy.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/clfr-sticker.git
    ```

    ```

3. Install packages and run the project:

## Usage

2. **Editing a Note:** Click on the note's content area to start typing. You can also click on the note's title to change it.
3. **Moving a Note:** Click and hold the note's title bar, then drag the note to your desired location on the screen.
4. **Resizing a Note:** Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the note to resize it.
5. **Saving Notes:** Your notes are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, so you don't need to worry about losing your work. Simply close your browser or navigate away from the page, and your notes will be there when you return.


## Future Plans

We are continuously working to improve Clfr Sticker and add more features. Some of the future enhancements include:

- **Customizable Themes:** Allowing users to customize the appearance of their notes with different themes and colors.
- **Search Functionality:** Adding a search feature to quickly find specific notes.
